# PRODIGY_GA_05
# Neural Style Transfer 🎨🖥️

This project implements **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub to blend a **content image** and a **style image**, generating a new image that maintains the structure of the content image while adopting the artistic style of the style image.

## Overview 🚀

Neural Style Transfer is a fascinating application of deep learning that combines:
- The **content** of one image (e.g., a portrait or landscape).
- The **style** of another image (e.g., a painting or pattern).

The result is a unique, AI-generated artwork!

## Project Features ✨
- **Content and Style Image Input**: Upload your custom content and style images.
- **Pretrained Model**: Uses TensorFlow Hub's pretrained model for arbitrary style transfer.
- **Output Generation**: Produces a stylized image combining the content and style.
- **Image Processing**: Preprocessing (resizing, normalization) and postprocessing (scaling) for efficient and accurate results.

## Technology Stack 🛠️
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow
  - TensorFlow Hub
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

## Usage 📖

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.7+.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub numpy opencv-python matplotlib
   
Steps to Run the Project

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/arunkishorai/PRODIGY_GA_05.git
cd PRODIGY_GA_05

Add your content image and style image to the project directory.
Replace the image file paths in the script with your images.

Run the script:
python neural app.py
The output will be saved as stylized_output.jpg in the project directory.

Example
Content Image: content.jpg
Style Image: style.jpg
Generated Image:
